abstract = "Today it is almost impossible to spend a single day without depending on an information system, a computer or any other form of computation. Though the starting barrier is low, fundamental concepts are still required in order to manage the technicalities of the engineering environment and everyday computational systems. In 1967, Logo proposed to teach abstract programming concepts by providing a set of functions that had intuitive, visible effects over a robotic Turtle. LOGO was a success, but the robots quickly migrated into computer simulations. From LOGO, many followed. Scratch and Lego Mindstorm are some of the most notorious examples. Both introduced graphical block-based programming interfaces. We propose to bring back the powerful ideas behind LOGO by updating it with state of the art technologies. Phogo combines Python, Arduino and 3D printing into a low cost robot that is easy to build and control. The robot has a pen to draw shapes and can be commanded from a computer via a wireless link that is transparent to the students. The use of a physical robot can make programming more accessible for students with disabilities. The open and maker philosophies behind Phogo makes it more interesting as students will be able to access and study the electronic components. The textual programing language can be a long life companion for the students. In this work we discuss LOGO and other projects inspired by it, and we also share the methodology and design decisions behind Phogo, the results of its application in a workshop and the improvements we are currently developing."

abstract = "OBJECTIVE
Providing feedback to surgical trainees is a critical component for assessment of technical skills, yet remains costly and time consuming. We hypothesize that statistical selection can identify a homogenous group of nonexpert crowdworkers capable of accurately grading inanimate surgical video.
DESIGN
Applicants auditioned by grading 9 training videos using the Objective Structured Assessment of Technical Skills (OSATS) tool and an error-based checklist. The summed OSATS, summed errors, and OSATS summary score were tested for outliers using Cronbach's Alpha and single measure intraclass correlation. Accepted crowdworkers then submitted grades for videos in 3 different compositions: full video 1× speed, full video 2× speed, and critical section segmented video. Graders were blinded to this study and a similar statistical analysis was performed.
SETTING
The study was conducted at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (Pittsburgh, PA), a tertiary care academic teaching hospital.
PARTICIPANTS
Thirty-six premedical students participated as crowdworker applicants and 2 surgery experts were compared as the gold-standard.
RESULTS
The selected hire intraclass correlation was 0.717 for Total Errors and 0.794 for Total OSATS for the first hire group and 0.800 for Total OSATS and 0.654 for Total Errors for the second hire group. There was very good correlation between full videos at 1× and 2× speed with an interitem statistic of 0.817 for errors and 0.86 for OSATS. Only moderate correlation was found with critical section segments. In 1 year 275hours of inanimate video was graded costing $22.27/video or $1.03/minute.
CONCLUSIONS
Statistical selection can be used to identify a homogenous cohort of crowdworkers used for grading trainees’ inanimate drills. Crowdworkers can distinguish OSATS metrics and errors in full videos at 2× speed but were less consistent with segmented videos. The program is a comparatively cost-effective way to provide feedback to surgical trainees."

abstract = "Introduction/Background
Neuroplasticity is believed to be an important mechanism related to motor improvement of spinal cord injury (SCI) during rehabilitation program, which may be enhanced using transcranial direct-current stimulation (tDCS). The better understanding of this process is important for the improvement of rehabilitation therapy since it can be used as a prognostic biomarker, surrogate outcome and to guide the parameters of tDCS. Functional Near Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS) is an instrument to measures hemodynamic responses in the brain, which allows studying functional brain connectivity reorganization. So, this study aims to demonstrate the feasibility of fNIRS to evaluate real-time activation of motor cortex SCI patients during robot-assisted gait. Besides, to compare changes induced by active vs. sham tDCS.
Material and method
It is a preliminary analysis of SCI patients enrolled in a randomized double-blind clinical trial, with two arms (active tDCS vs. sham tDCS). Both groups received 30 sessions of tDCS for 20minutes immediately before gait training with robotic-assisted device Lokomat-Pro® (Hocoma). For fNIRS, 32 optodes was positioned parallel to the coronal plane. Software and hardware are from NIRX Medical Technologies. The differential hemoglobin index at rest (standing) and during movement were evaluated using paired T-test. The null hypothesis was that during gait, metabolic consumption would increase in the primary motor cortex (M1).
Results
Patients had an enhanced activation of M1, next to Cz, C1 and C2 (10-20 EEG system) during gait, when compared with standing position. This activation seems to be higher in active group comparing to sham group (Fig. 1).
Conclusion
This study shows the viability of use fNIRS to measure brain activity of SCI patients during robot-assisted gait. Future analyses, with a larger sample, are necessary to confirm these findings and correlate it with clinical outcomes."

One objective of acute stroke rehabilitation is restoration and improvement of arm use. The aim of this study is to determine feasibility and efficiency of additional exercise in acute stroke inpatient rehabilitation facility (IRF) using the Armeo-Spring® (ARMEO) robot vs. therapist supervised Table Top (TT) exercises.
Material and method
Blinded, randomized, study using TT or ARMEO in addition to 3hours of 1:1 required therapy. Participants with unilateral hemiparesis≥18 years with a minimum Fugl-Meyer Assessment score of 8/66 or Modified Ashworth Scale score of<3 after acute stroke. Outcome measures Number of treatment sessions; serious/adverse events (S/AEs); Functional Independence Measure (FIM) efficiency; and Modified Borg Rating of therapist Perceived Exertion Scale (RPE).
Results
Thirty-six participants enrolled in the study thus far. ARMEO participants on average had more training days (6.6) than TT (5.9); number of training days was not statistically different (P=.59). FIM efficiency was not significantly different. There was statistically significant median decrease in Borg from last day of training to the first day of training in both ARMEO or TT groups, P<.005. Five ARMEO participants and eight TT participants reported AEs. No SAEs were reported.
Conclusion
Acute stroke patients are able to tolerate and participate in an additional functional exercise program in an IRF without SAEs. Although the training groups did not yet yield statistical significance, FIM efficiency improved and therapist effort decreased. This study supports early recovery in acute stroke rehabilitation and ARMEO was preferred training mode and with good patient satisfaction."

To assess the accuracy of detecting robot-simulated head movements using video observation (VO) and 3-dimensional head tracking (HT) in a cone beam computed tomography examination setup.
Study Design
A mannequin head was mounted on a robot that was programmed to simulate patient head movements. Six types of movement (tremor, nodding, lateral rotation, lifting, swallowing, and anteroposterior translation), 3 distances (0.25, 1, and 5 mm), and 2 speeds (1 and 5 mm/s) were tested in triplicate (108 examinations). An additional 18 videos and HT of no-motion served as controls for a total of 126 examinations. Three blinded observers viewed video recordings of the examinations, scoring whether the head moved and the movement type. HT provided quantitative measures of movement distance. Accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity for movement detection by VO and HT were calculated, related to true type, distance, and speed of movement. Differences between the true and the measured movement distances were assessed for HT.
Results
VO movement detection presented accuracy of 0.86, sensitivity of 0.85, and specificity of 0.94. Anteroposterior translation (33.3%) and 0.25 mm movements (41.7%) were often not detected by VO. HT correctly detected all cases (accuracy = 1). HT presented small differences between the true and the measured movement distances (average 20-54 μm).
Conclusions
VO missed 41.7% of the 0.25 mm movements. HT correctly detected all movements and quantified movements with an average error <55 μm."

Gait training is one of the main objectives in rehabilitation of motor incomplete spinal cord injury (SCI). There are different modalities of locomotion training, being the robotic orthosis among them, and offering until now, positive outcomes. However there is still a lack of evidence of the optimal training characteristics.
Objective
To determine the effect of two different training programs with robotic gait orthosis for patients with chronic motor incomplete SCI.
Material and method
Study design: randomized, blinded to the observer, clinical trial. Patients from the National Institute of Rehabilitation (INR) with motor incomplete SCI, with at least 6 months of evolution and who were able to walk, were eligible. Patients were randomly assigned to either one of the two different training groups: 30minutes or 60minutes training group. Both groups received a training period of six weeks, five days a week. Assessments of gait pattern analysis with the GaitRite instrument, functional assessment with Spinal Cord Independence measure (SCIM), walking index for spinal cord injury (WISCI) and quality of life with life satisfaction questionnaire (Lisat-9); repeating such evaluations in a 6 and 12 months follow-up.
Results
In total, 12 participants were studied. After 30 training sessions with the robotic orthosis, both groups had significant improvements in gait as well as in SCIM, LISAT-9 and WISCI. No significant differences between groups were found.
Conclusion
Robotic orthosis gait training has a positive effect improving gait pattern in incomplete SCI. Until now, there are no significant differences between a 30minutes and a 60minutes-training program."

While performance feedback and assessment are hallmarks of surgical training, they abruptly cease after training is completed. In their absence, performance may stagnate and poor habits persist. Our aim was to develop a coaching mechanism for practicing surgeons with feedback provision based on objective performance assessment.
Methods
Technical and nontechnical intraoperative video recordings from laparoscopic or robotic cholecystectomies, colectomies, and hysterectomies were assessed by a blinded surgeon and a human factors expert, respectively. Aspects of performance in need of improvement were noted, and a coaching session was developed for feedback provision to participating surgeons. This 4-hour coaching session consisted of a didactic lecture with video review and hands-on practice using procedural and mannequin-based simulation.
Results
Thirty-two practicing surgeons (18 general; 14 gynecologists) from 6 different hospitals were assessed, and 9 of them participated in coaching. Technical aspects identified for performance improvement included suboptimal trocar placement, inadequate critical view achievement during laparoscopic cholecystectomies, poor visualization of the operating field, bimanual dexterity, and dissection techniques, while nontechnical aspects included inappropriate handling of distractions and interruptions, poor ergonomic positioning and situational awareness, and inadequate mitigation of delays. Most surgeons appropriately accomplished some of the objectives of the distraction scenario, but none was able to achieve expert levels on Fundamentals of Laparoscopy tasks. Participants perceived the coaching sessions as highly valuable.
Conclusion
Our study identified several technical and nontechnical skill sets of practicing surgeons in need of improvement and provided support for the implementation of coaching programs for surgeons on an ongoing basis."

abstract = "Résumé
Objectifs
Les neuroprothèses sont des dispositifs électroniques ou électromécaniques reliés au système nerveux permettant de remplacer un organe défectueux. Cet article a pour but de faire le point sur l’état actuel de ces dispositifs.
Méthode
Cet article aborde successivement différentes neuroprothèses. Si l’implant cochléaire existe maintenant depuis presque 60 ans, cette dernière décennie, les solutions technologiques pour restaurer d’autres sens comme la vue avec des rétines artificielles et le toucher avec des peaux artificielles ont fait d’importants progrès. De même, les myoprothèses, les interfaces cerveau-machine et les exosquelettes qui visent à restaurer le contrôle d’un membre occupent régulièrement l’actualité. Les myoprothèses sont destinées à pallier l’absence d’un membre supérieur suite à une amputation en enregistrant depuis la surface de la peau en amont l’influx nerveux transmis jusqu’aux muscles pour commander une prothèse de main. Les interfaces cerveau-machines enregistrent l’activité de neurones à l’intérieur du cortex moteur, plus rarement depuis la surface du scalp, pour décoder l’ordre moteur et le transmettre à un membre motorisé. Enfin, les exosquelettes sont des armatures mécaniques enveloppant tout ou une partie du corps pour l’animer.
Résultats
Les implants cochléaires et les myoprothèses sont maintenant régulièrement proposés respectivement aux personnes souffrant d’un déficit auditif sévère ou profond et aux personnes amputées au niveau de l’avant-bras. L’augmentation de la résolution des rétines artificielles devrait permettre à moyen terme de proposer aux personnes non aveugles de naissance mais atteintes de dégénérescence maculaire liée à l’âge une perception visuelle sommaire de leur environnement. Enfin, les neuroprothèses motrices non invasives commencent à être intégrées à des programmes de rééducation des accidents vasculaires cérébraux. Celles plus invasives permettant de décoder jusqu’à la direction du mouvement nécessiteront encore de nombreuses années de recherche, en particulier pour intégrer un retour sensitif.
Discussion
Ainsi, au-delà des effets d’annonce pour obtenir l’attention du public et des financeurs, et de l’enthousiasme des journalistes pour la nouveauté, qu’en est-il des attentes des potentiels utilisateurs, des désillusions et des satisfactions vécues par les patients, du nombre réel de personnes équipées, du prix et des possibilités d’utiliser de tels dispositifs en dehors des laboratoires ?
Conclusions
Cet article vise à positionner ces nouvelles technologies entre réalité et fiction, attentes des personnes soumises à un handicap, fantasmes de l’Homme augmenté et difficultés scientifiques.
Introduction
Neuroprostheses are electronic or electromechanical devices connected to the nervous system to replace a defective organ. This article aims to review the state of the art of these devices.
Methods
This article successively presents various neuroprostheses. While cochlear implants have existed now for almost 60 years, in the last decade, technological solutions to restore other senses, such as sight with artificial retinas, and touch with artificial skins, have made significant progress. Similarly, myoprostheses, brain-machine interfaces and exoskeletons, which aim to restore the control of a limb, often make headlines in the news. Myoprostheses are intended to compensate for the lack of an amputated upper limb by registering nerve impulses transmitted to the muscles from the skin surface to control a prosthetic hand. Brain-computer interfaces register neural activity within the motor cortex, or more rarely from the surface of the scalp, to decode the motor order and transmit it to a motorized limb. Finally, exoskeletons are mechanical structures enveloping all or part of the body to animate it.
Results
Cochlear implants and myoelectric prosthetics are now regularly offered for people with severe or profound hearing loss and for forearm amputees. Increasing the resolution of artificial retinas should help in the medium term to offer a basic visual perception of their environment, if not to people blind from birth, at least to macular degeneration sufferers. Finally, non-invasive motor neuroprostheses are now being included in rehabilitation programs for stroke. Invasive neuroprostheses actually able to decode the direction of movement will still require many years of research, in particular to integrate sensory feedback.
Discussion
Thus, beyond the spectacular aspect of communications on the subject to get the attention of the public and funders, and the enthusiasm for novelty of journalists, the real issues are the expectations of potential users, the disappointments and satisfactions of patients, the actual number of people equipped, and cost and scope for use of such devices outside the laboratories.
Conclusion
This article aims to position these new technologies in terms of reality and fiction, in terms of the expectations of people with a disability and fantasies of the augmented human, and in terms of the scientific difficulties encountered."

To compare the currently available simulation training modalities used to teach robotic surgery.
Methods
Forty surgical trainees completed a standardized robotic 10-cm dissection of the internal thoracic artery and placed 3 sutures of a mitral valve annuloplasty in porcine models and were then randomized to a wet lab, a dry lab, a virtual reality lab, or a control group that received no additional training. All groups trained to a level of proficiency determined by 2 expert robotic cardiac surgeons. All assessments were evaluated using the Global Evaluative Assessment of Robotic Skills in a blinded fashion.
Results
Wet lab trainees showed the greatest improvement in time-based scoring and the objective scoring tool compared with the experts (mean, 24.9 ± 1.7 vs 24.9 ± 2.6; P = .704). The virtual reality lab improved their scores and met the level of proficiency set by our experts for all primary outcomes (mean, 24.9 ± 1.7 vs 22.8 ± 3.7; P = .103). Only the control group trainees were not able to meet the expert level of proficiency for both time-based scores and the objective scoring tool (mean, 24.9 ± 1.7 vs 11.0 ± 4.5; P < .001). The average duration of training was shortest for the dry lab and longest for the virtual reality simulation (1.6 hours vs 9.3 hours; P < .001).
Conclusions
We have completed the first randomized controlled trial to objectively compare the different training modalities of robotic surgery. Our data demonstrate the significant benefits of wet lab and virtual reality robotic simulation training and highlight key differences in current training methods. This study can help guide training programs in investing resources in cost-effective, high-yield simulation exercises."
